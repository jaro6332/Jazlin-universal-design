      <h2>Premise</h2>
      <p>
        Based out of the NYPD New York City Police Department's 16th precinct in Manhattan, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit delves into the dark side of the New York underworld as the detectives of a new elite squad, the Special Victims Unit (SVU for short), investigate and prosecute various sexually oriented crimes, including rape, child sexual abuse, human trafficking and domestic violence. They also investigate the abuses of children, the disabled and elderly victims of non-sexual crimes who require specialist handling, all while trying to balance the effects of the investigation on their own lives as they try not to let the dark side of these crimes affect them.</p>
    <p>
        Its stories also touch on the political and societal issues associated with gender identity, sexual preferences, and equality rights. While the victim is often murdered, this is not always the case, and victims frequently play prominent roles in episodes. The unit also works with the Manhattan District Attorney's office as they prosecute cases and seek justice for SVU's victims and survivors with precision and a passion to win and bring closure to the intense investigations. The series often uses stories that are "ripped from the headlines" or based on real crimes. Such episodes take a real crime and fictionalize it by changing some details.[11]

        <h2> Cast and Characters</h2>
        <p>
            Originally, the show focused around the detective pairing of Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay). Stabler is a seasoned veteran of the unit who has seen it all and tries his best to protect his family from the horrors he has seen in his career. Meanwhile, Benson's difficult past as the child of a rape victim is the reason she joined the unit. Backing them up are Detective John Munch (Richard Belzer) and his first partner, Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters). Munch is a transfer from Baltimore's homicide unit, who brings his acerbic wit, conspiracy theories, and street-honed investigative skills; Cassidy is young and eager to learn from his fellow detectives.</p>

            </figure>
<p>These two detective teams received support from Detectives Monique Jeffries (Michelle Hurd) and Ken Briscoe (Chris Orbach).[10] After thirteen episodes, Cassidy gets transferred to the narcotics division because of his inability to work well on the cases and the fact that they reminded him too much of his childhood abuse. As a result, Jeffries gets partnered up with Munch for the remainder of season one and Briscoe was phased out.</p>

<p>In the beginning of season two, Jeffries leaves the unit following an incident with the Morris Commission and Munch gets permanently partnered up with Detective Odafin "Fin" Tutuola (Ice-T), whose unique yet sometimes vulgar sense of humor and investigative experience make him a formidable match for Munch.[12]</p>

<p>Brooklyn SVU Detective Chester Lake (Adam Beach) would assist on several Manhattan cases during the eighth season and then join during season nine; Lake would then depart at the season's end after being arrested for murdering a crooked cop who had gotten away with rape.</p>

<p>These detectives were supervised by veteran Captain Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), who oversaw the team for seasons 1–15 and was previously the commanding officer of the Manhattan North Homicide precinct on the first 3 seasons of Law & Order. Cragen's tough-but-supportive approach to the team's complex cases guides the squad through the challenges they face every day.</p>

<p>Also assisting the Special Victims Unit, is FBI Special Agent Dr. George Huang (BD Wong) who helps keep the officers sane in a field that could drive ordinary people mad, whilst also serving as the squad's resident criminal profiler, his insights into the criminal mind have often helped the officers to crack the toughest perps. The team also works with Medical Examiner Dr. Melinda Warner (Tamara Tunie), who has become an integral part of the unit, and her personal skills have contributed to the unit's high success rate in closing cases.[citation needed]</p>

<p>The unit did not receive a full-time assistant district attorney until season two, when Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was assigned to work with the detectives.[13] After Cabot enters the Witness Protection Program after almost being killed in a hit in season five, she was replaced by Casey Novak (Diane Neal), who remained as the ADA until the end of season nine, when she was censured for violating due process while trying to bring a rapist cop to justice. Kim Greylek (Michaela McManus) became the permanent ADA in the season ten premiere, until Cabot made a return midway through that season when Greylek returned to the Justice Department in Washington, D.C. Cabot remained the ADA through the second half of season 10.</p>

<p>After Cabot's departure, the ADA void was filled by Sonya Paxton (Christine Lahti) and Jo Marlowe (Sharon Stone) until the conclusion of season 11. Gillian Hardwicke (Melissa Sagemiller) served as the SVU's ADA during season 12, while Novak would return for a guest appearance after completing her suspension near the end of the season. Paxton would also return for one more appearance in the season, during which she is brutally murdered by a rapist/murderer, but manages to leave behind vital evidence to assure his conviction. In season 13, both Cabot and Novak returned as ADAs. From the beginning of season 14, ADA Rafael Barba (Raúl Esparza) was SVU's prosecutor, until leaving halfway through season 19 following the death of an infant.</p>

<p>Chicago Justice's Peter Stone (Philip Winchester) became SVU's ADA after Chicago Justice was canceled after only one season. At the end of season 20, Stone decided to leave due to some of the cases being too much for him to handle. From there, former SVU Detective Dominick Carisi Jr. (Peter Scanavino) takes his place at the start of season 21.[14]</p>

<p>In season 13, big changes happen when Stabler retires in the aftermath of the season 12 finale, until he reappeared in season 22, which led him to join NYPD's Organized Crime Control Bureau in Law & Order: Organized Crime. Huang also departed at the same time after being reassigned to Oklahoma City, but has returned for occasional guest appearances. Detectives Nick Amaro (Danny Pino) and Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish) joined the team filling the void left by Stabler. Amaro brought empathy to his cases while dealing with a stressful home life, while Rollins had dogged persistence and instincts help her close cases, but also secrets from her past that could derail her career.</p>

<p>During season 15, both Munch and Cragen retired from the NYPD, leaving Benson, after being promoted to Sergeant, to take control of the unit; she would later be promoted to Lieutenant at the start of season 17 and then Captain at the start of season 21. Season 16 was another period of change with the introduction of Carisi at the beginning and the departure of Amaro at the end, with the latter relocating to California to be near his moved children after being wounded in the line of duty and learning that previous instances of misconduct have cost him any chance for advancement in the department. Also introduced in season 16 was Deputy Chief William Dodds (Peter Gallagher), who served as commanding officer for the Special Victims Units in all five boroughs of New York. Dodds' son Mike (Andy Karl) transfers into Special Victims as Sergeant in season 17, becoming Benson's second-in-command until his death at the end of the season; Fin later passes the Sergeant's exam during season 18 and is officially promoted in Mike's place in season 19.</p>

<p>Following Carisi's move to the DA's office in season 21, Vice Officer Katriona "Kat" Tamin (Jamie Gray Hyder) joined the team after assisting on several cases, eventually getting promoted to detective. Dodds also departed the series at the start of the season due to some issues in the case regarding a mogul raping countless women, allowing new deputy chief Christian Garland (Demore Barnes) to take his place. At the start of season 23, Tamin and Garland both resigned from the NYPD after becoming disillusioned with the legal system's failures and the systemic bias within the department, with Tamin being replaced by Detective Joe Velasco (Octavio Pisano). Chief Tommy McGrath (Terry Serpico) took over Garland's position until he could find a permanent deputy chief for SVU.</p>

<p>At the beginning of season 24, Detective Grace Muncy (Molly Burnett) joined SVU after solving a case that involves a teenage Dominican gang, while Rollins resigned from SVU and the NYPD halfway through the season after accepting an offer from Carisi's old colleague to teach at Fordham University. SVU also brought in Detectives Terry Bruno (Kevin Kane) and Tonie Churlish (Jasmine Batchelor) from their Brooklyn counterparts. Muncy later departed at the end of the season to work on a DEA task force and Churlish also left during the same time. In season 25, McGrath is replaced as chief after crossing multiple lines in his interference with his daughter's rape case, and IAB Captain Renee Curry (Aime Donna Kelly) joins SVU in hopes of making changes. Shortly afterwards, FBI agent Shannah Sykes (Jordana Spiro) would be put on loan to SVU after helping them rescue abducted girl Maddie Flynn.[15]

        <h2>Production</h2>
        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p>
            The idea for Law & Order: Special Victims Unit originated with the 1986 "preppie murder" case of Robert Chambers, who strangled and killed a woman he dated, Jennifer Levin, during what he claimed was consensual "rough sex" in Manhattan's Central Park. The crime inspired Dick Wolf to write the story for the season one episode of Law & Order titled "Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die". After writing the episode, Wolf wanted to go deeper into the psychology of crimes to examine the role of human sexuality.[16]

The original title of the show was Sex Crimes. Initially, there was concern among the producers that, should Sex Crimes fail, identifying the new show with the Law & Order franchise could affect the original show. Additionally, Ted Kotcheff wanted to create a new series that was not dependent upon the original series for success. Wolf felt, however, that it was important and commercially desirable to have "Law & Order" in the title, and he initially proposed the title of the show be Law & Order: Sex Crimes. Barry Diller, then head of Studios USA, was concerned about the title, however, and it was changed to Law & Order: Special Victims Unit to reflect the actual unit of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) that handles sexually-based offenses.[17]

        <h3>Casting</h3>
        <p>
            Casting for the lead characters of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit occurred in the spring of 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center. The last round had been narrowed down to seven finalists. For the female lead, Detective Olivia Benson, actresses Samantha Mathis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Mariska Hargitay were being considered. For the male role, Detective Elliot Stabler, the finalists were Tim Matheson, John Slattery, Nick Chinlund, and Christopher Meloni. Hargitay and Meloni had auditioned in the final round together and, after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, "Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose—Hargitay and Meloni." Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together, and they ended up being his first choice. Garth Ancier, then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent.[26]
