                <h3>WCAG</h3>
                <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), are a set of internationally recognized standards for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. These guidelines are critical for ensuring that websites, applications, and digital documents are usable by everyone, including individuals with visual, auditory, cognitive, or physical disabilities.

                </p>
                <h4>The Four Principles of WCAG 2.0</h4>
                <h4>POUR</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Perceivable</strong>: Users must be able to perceive the information being presented (it can't be invisible to their senses). Examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Provide text alternatives for non-text content (e.g., alt text for images).</li>
                            <li>Offer captions for videos and transcripts for audio content.</li>
                            <li>Use sufficient contrast between text and background colors for readability.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Operable</strong>: Users must be able to operate the interface, regardless of the device or assistive technology they use. Examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ensure all functionalities are accessible via keyboard navigation.</li>
                            <li>Avoid designing elements that could trigger seizures, such as flashing content.</li>
                            <li>Provide clear navigation mechanisms, such as consistent menus.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Understandable</strong>: Content must be presented in a clear and predictable way so users can comprehend it. Examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use plain language where possible and define technical terms.</li>
                            <li>Ensure forms have clear labels and instructions.</li>
                            <li>Provide feedback for user errors and suggestions for correction.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Robust</strong>: Content must work with a wide variety of technologies, including assistive devices. Examples:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Use clean and valid HTML and CSS for compatibility.</li>
                            <li>Test your site with screen readers and other assistive technologies.</li>
                            <li>Ensure dynamic content updates are communicated to assistive technologies.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each criterion also falls into one of three levels of compliance: A, AA, and AAA representing minimum, must have, and good to have respectively.

                <h3>Coding practices</h3>
                <p>The best way to ensure a usable site is by implementing accessible coding practices.</p>
                <section>
                    <h4>Semantic Structure</h4>
                        <p>Semantic structure involves organizing and coding web content meaningfully, using HTML elements that convey the purpose and relationship of the content. It enhances accessibility, improves SEO, and ensures a logical, user-friendly experience.</p>
                        <p>Benefits of semantic structure:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improves accessibility</li>
                            <li>Enhances search engine organization</li>
                            <li>Eases maintenance</li>
                            <li>Promotes consistency</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Using regions, headings, and lists provides a clear hierarchical structure to a webpage.</p>

                <h3>Accessibility Testing tools</h3>
                <p>There are various tools you can use to test the accessibility of your site:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wave & Silktide - These browser extensions help identify accessibility issues on your site. WAVE highlights errors directly on the page, while Silktide offers additional features, such as an in-browser screen reader, simulations for vision impairments and dyslexia, and a focus order overlay to analyze navigation.</li>
                    <li>Validator.nu - Based on the W3C validator, this tool allows you to assess HTML for semantic accuracy and accessibility. It supports both live URLs and local code files.</li>
                    <li>Adobe Color - This online tool assists in selecting color palettes that meet WCAG AA and AAA contrast standards. It also checks if your color choices are safe for users with color blindness.</li>
                    <li>Outline extension - This extension generates a semantic outline of your website, helping you verify that the structure is logically organized for assistive technologies.</li>
                    <li>Chrome's Dev Tools - Google Chrome's built-in developer tools offer powerful options for accessibility testing. Use the grid overlay for responsive design checks and the Lighthouse tool to generate detailed accessibility reports and evaluate your siteâ€™s adherence to coding best practices.</li>
