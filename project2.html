            <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
            <p>A strategy for designing products, environments, and services to be usable by people of all abilities, ages, and other factors</p>
            <p> It's purpose is to create designsthat are accessible to everyone, without the need for specialized design or adaptation.</p>
            <h3>Applications</h3>
            <p>Universal design can be applied in many areas, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The physical enviorment</li>
                <li>Products</li>
                <li>Services</li>
                <li>Communications</li>
                <li>Technology</li>
                <li>Digital strategy</li>
            </ul>
            <section>
                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Universal design on a website is the practice of creating digital experiences that are accessible, usable, and inclusive for all people, regardless of their abilities, age, language, or technology preferences. It is rooted in the principle of equityâ€”ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity to interact with and benefit from the content, services, or tools provided online.</p>
                <p>Unlike accessibility, which often focuses on adapting designs to meet the needs of people with disabilities, universal design goes a step further by incorporating inclusivity from the outset. It seeks to create websites that work well for as many users as possible, reducing the need for specialized adaptations or alternative solutions.</p>

                <h3>The 7 principles</h3>
                <p>The 7 Principles of Universal Design, developed by a team of architects, designers, and researchers provide a framework for designing products, environments, and experiences that are inclusive for all people, regardless of ability, age, or other factors. </p>
                <p>The 7 principles of Universal Design are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Equitable Use - The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</li>
                    <li>Flexibility in Use - The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</li>
                    <li>Simple, Intuitive Use - Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user's experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</li>
                    <li>Perceptible Information - The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.</li>
                    <li>Tolerance for Error - The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</li>
                    <li>Low Physical Effort - The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.</li>
                    <li>Size and Space for Approach and Use - Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Norman's design concepts</h3>
                <p>Don Norman, a pioneer in the field of human-centered design, introduced fundamental principles for creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. These principles emphasize understanding user needs and creating designs that feel natural, logical, and efficient. </p>
                <p>Norman's principles of design are:</p>
                
                    <ul>Affordance
                        <li>Affordance refers to the properties of an object or interface that indicate how it can be used.</li>
                        <li>Application in Web Design: Buttons should look clickable, sliders should be draggable, and links should stand out as interactive elements. For example, a button should resemble a physical button with clear edges and shading, signaling to users that they can press it.</li> 
                    </ul>
                    <ul>Signifiers
                        <li> Signifiers are visual or auditory cues that clarify how to interact with an element.</li>
                        <li>Application in Web Design: Use clear labels, icons, or visual indicators like underlined links or tooltips to guide users. For instance, a trash can icon for deleting items signals its function immediately.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>Feedback
                        <li> Feedback is the response a user receives after interacting with a system, confirming their action was registered.</li>
                        <li>Application in Web Design: After submitting a form, display a success message or loading animation. Interactive elements like buttons can provide feedback through hover effects or color changes to confirm they are clickable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Mapping
                        <ul>Mapping refers to the relationship between controls and their effects, ensuring the connection feels logical and intuitive.</ul>
                        <ul>Application in Web Design: Place related controls near each other, such as grouping form fields logically. For example, a volume slider should visually map to increasing or decreasing sound, aligning with user expectations.
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Constraints
                       <ul>Constraints limit the range of possible actions, helping users avoid errors.</ul>
                       <ul>Application in Web Design: Disable a "Submit" button until all required fields are filled out. Similarly, input fields can restrict characters to valid formats, such as numbers for phone entries or dates for calendar inputs.</ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Consistency</li>
                    <ul>Consistency ensures that similar elements behave and appear the same across the interface.</ul>
                    <ul>Application in Web Design: Use a uniform style for buttons, navigation, and typography throughout your site. Consistent interaction patterns make it easier for users to predict how to navigate and interact with new pages.</ul>
