        <p> Dancing with the Stars is an American dance competition television series that premiered on ABC on June 1, 2005. It is the American version of the British series Strictly Come Dancing, and one of several iterations of the Dancing with the Stars franchise. The show pairs celebrities with professional dancers. Each couple competes against the others for judges' points and audience votes. The couple receiving the lowest combined total of judges' points and audience votes is usually eliminated each week until only the champion dance pair remains. The series is hosted by Alfonso Ribeiro and Julianne Hough, with Carrie Ann Inaba, Derek Hough, and Bruno Tonioli serving as judges.</p>

            <p>Tom Bergeron (who was also hosting America's Funniest Home Videos, also on ABC, at the time of the show's debut) was the host for the show's first 28 seasons, beginning with its premiere in 2005.[8] In season 1, his co-host was Lisa Canning. She was subsequently replaced by Samantha Harris for seasons 2 through 9 (2006–2009),[9] who was then replaced by Brooke Burke-Charvet from seasons 10 through 17 (2010–2013). Erin Andrews took over as co-host starting in season 18 (2014).[10]</p>
            <p>On July 13, 2020, Bergeron announced in a tweet that he had been let go from the series. ABC and BBC Studios made an official announcement shortly afterward saying Andrews would also be exiting the program.[11] The following day, model and host Tyra Banks was announced to be joining the show as host in addition to serving as an executive producer for the twenty-ninth season.[12] On July 14, 2022, it was announced that Alfonso Ribeiro would join Banks as co-host for the thirty-first season.[13][14] On March 17, 2023, it was revealed that Banks would be leaving the show prior to the thirty-second season.[15] Three days later, it was announced that Julianne Hough would be joining as co-host for season 32,[16] while Ribeiro was elevated to main host.[17]</p>

            <p>The regular judges included Len Goodman, who served as head judge, Carrie Ann Inaba, and Bruno Tonioli.[18] Goodman was absent for much of season 19, the entire season 21, much of season 23, and the entire season 29. Julianne Hough, who had been a professional dancing partner for seasons 4 through 8, was added as a full-time judge for seasons 19 through 21,[19] after having been a guest judge in the previous two seasons.[20] She did not return for season 22, but she did return as a full-time judge for seasons 23 and 24, but did not return subsequently.[19] Julianne's brother, Derek Hough, replaced Len Goodman for season 29, as Goodman was unable to travel from London to Los Angeles due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, though he was able to "share his ballroom expertise" during the season via pre-taped clips.[21][22] Goodman announced during the season 31 semifinals that he would be retiring from the show at the end of the season.[23]
